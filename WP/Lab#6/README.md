Development:
-----------

It didn't took a lot of time to do this application because I'm a little experienced with C# and Forms.
More time I used for thinking logic of how to programatically create labels,textboxes and arrange them in dependence of the number of players.
I will say that I also gained some experice working with WPF.I realized that there are some controls better than in WinForms, others are not so evoluated as in Winforms.
