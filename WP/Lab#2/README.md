Application Creation Steps
--------------------------

I thought that it will be better if I will continue to develop my game, this way I will update my game and make the laboratory too.

  I started from the menu and the dialog box,so I read about resources file and how to declare them.It wasn't as tough as I imagined.So it wasn't very though to implement it. 
  
  Then I set a image for background in the paint wm.
  
  I thought that will be more interesting if the application will have 2 backgrounds and the user could change the background by pressing the combination Ctrl + Space or by setting the background image in the Edit menu list.Also I added the combination Ctrl + Q that will close the app.
  
  Next step was declaration of the icon and cursor for the application and to set them in app, it was piece of cake.
  
  Then I wanted to make  my edit box with guessed words clickable, but I encountered some problems because there is no such event for a edit box.So I resolved this problem by changing my edit box with guessed words with a list box and it worked fine.
  
  At the end I just added the scroll bars for the app that will change the position of the app.
