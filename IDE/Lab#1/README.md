# IDE Laboratory Work #1

## Subject

Command Line Interface; CLI Editors; Setting Server Environment; Version Control Systems

## Objectives:
  - Understanding and using CLI (basic level)
  - Administration of a remote linux machine using SSH
  - Ability to work remotely (remote code editing)
  - Ability to work with VCS

## Executed Tasks:
  - **Mandatory Tasks:**
    - Connect to a remote server via SSH
    - Initialize a repository on server
    - Create a file in repository folder, write in your name, save it and commit it
  - **Tasks With Points:**
    - Connect to server using public key (1 pt)
    - Create 2 more branches with at least one unique committed file per branch (1 pt)
    - Set a branch to track a remote origin on which you are able to push (ex. github, bitbucket or a custom server) (1 pt)
    - Reset a branch to previous commit, reset a branch to some specific commit (1 pt)
    - Restore a reset branch back to its previous state (1 pt)
    - Create a VCS alias (1 pt)
  - **Additional Tasks:**
    - Referencing to commits using branch titles

## Theoretical Work:
I used VCS only in two projects,but I used it in order to push the info on the repository but I never used branches or something else.That's why this laboratory work was very interesting for me because I learned the basics of branches and other stuff like alias and hook.
Also it was interesting because it was the first time when I connected by an SSH connection and worked remote with git.It was awesome.Also I found new things in terminal,because I never worked with terminal so much as in this laboratory work.
I found the vim and the basics terminal commands like:ls,mkdir,cat,cp,rm and cd.Also I learned some new commands in vim.

##Practical Work
Some of them are used for working with files another for working with text. :q-quit,w-write,r-read,!-not save the changes,w-next word,b-,[-to the nt sentence,]-to the previous sentence
