## Development
 
The tasks of this laboratory work weren't so tough if I could be using .NET or even JAVA, but unfortunately I cannot use them. So I choose Python with PyCharm.
  From the start it seemed easy, I created a new project, then in order to create necesarry files and configuration I used pycharm terminal with command django-admin.py startproject mysite what create the main struc of the project.Then in order to create the MVT you have to put command: python manage.py startapp polls.
  After that I had some problems with routing, I only managed to route the template files, but with static files like css and images I had problems.Another thing that I couldn't config it was db, I wanted to use postgress but don't know why the driver that I downloaded hadn't worked.
  And all of this is because I left this laboratory for the last day.
